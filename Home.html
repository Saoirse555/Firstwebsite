        <p>Children/Young Adults of all ages are assigned into different sections. Kildare Town Scouts has a dedicated team . </p>
       
       <br>

        <p>This is the place to give updates and share information. Please remember it is against Scouting Ireland's policy for a   Scouter (leader) to be friends on Facebook with a youth member (Beaver, Cub, Scout, Venture Scout).
            We are the Scout Group for Kildare Town. We currently cater for Beavers (6-9 year olds), Cubs (9-12 year olds) and Scouts (12-15 year olds). There is a place for everyone in Scouting, so get in touch if you would like to become involved. You don't have to have been involved as a youth member to become involved as an adult. From September, Beavers and Scouts will meet on Mondays and Cubs on Thursdays. See our <a href=' http://4thkildaretownscouts.com/'>website</a>for more information about our meetings</p>
          <br>
       <p>Each different section allows children to progress, follows similiar structure to the Irish school system. It is very good for children to learn independence through camping but also to create lifelong friendships.That is what the <a href= 'https://www.scouts.ie/about-scouting-ireland/about-us'>OneProgramme</a> allows children to bond over similiar interests. </p>
